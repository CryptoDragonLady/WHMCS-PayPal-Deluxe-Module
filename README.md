# WHMCS-PayPal-Deluxe-Module
A complete PayPal Gateway for WHMS with additional features that aren’t included in the standard PayPal Gateway. We are releasing this module to the public as we are not officially supporting it any longer.


# Features

#### Choose the NEW PayPal Checkout Design, or the NEW In-Context Checkout!

Now you can choose between the NewPayPal Checkout design or the New In-Context version! See images on the right for examples.

 

#### Fully PCI Compliant

No PayPal or card details are stored on your site, only a PayPal token, ensuring your site meets the latest PCI requirements.

 
#### Confirmed PayPal Address Compatibility

Check your client’s PayPal Account addresses for added seller security, as they now are included in the PayPal transaction details.

 
#### Choose between one-time or subscription payments – or both!

You can choose whether to allow just one-time payments, or to offer subscription payments as well!

 
#### Auto-Cancel PayPal Subscription upon Product Cancellation

The client’s PayPal Subscription will be cancelled when the WHMCS product is marked as cancelled!
